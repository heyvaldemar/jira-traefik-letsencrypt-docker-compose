# # jira-restore-application-data.sh Description
# This script is designed to restore the application data.
# 1. **Identify Containers**: Similarly to the database restore script, it identifies the service and backups containers by name.
# 2. **List Application Data Backups**: Displays all available application data backups at the specified backup path.
# 3. **Select Backup**: Asks the user to copy and paste the desired backup name for application data restoration.
# 4. **Stop Service**: Stops the service to prevent any conflicts during the restore process.
# 5. **Restore Application Data**: Removes the current application data and then extracts the selected backup to the appropriate application data path.
# 6. **Start Service**: Restarts the service after the application data has been successfully restored.
# To make the `jira-restore-application-data.sh` script executable, run the following command:
# `chmod +x jira-restore-application-data.sh`
# By utilizing this script, you can efficiently restore application data from an existing backup while ensuring proper coordination with the running service.
